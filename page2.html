In line with this, we also had our first activity that is called “Tell me about yourself” in this activity, our professor had the chance to know us deeper about our background, likes, hobbies and what are our expectations on this subject.<br><br>To tell you about the design process, I will tell you the operation involved in this process. First and for most, you can’t use this process with out the problem, so you need to have a problem. Next will be the collection of information or data for you to have a background on your problem. Then, here comes the brainstorming and analyzation of the problem, on this process the person itself is thinking of what he/she would do to his/her problem or what are the possible ways to solve this one. Furthermore, the next step would be the solutions or development of a model. In this step, he/she would create a possible solution for the problem. Moreover, the second to the last step would be the presentation of your ideas to others, so that you can hear from others on what are their ideas or knowledge about the problem. Lastly, the improvement of your design. In the last step of the process, the improvement of the design is where the person is developing his/her design to enhance  the work. &nbsp;<br></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="carousel-item slider-fullscreen-image" data-bg-video-slide="false" style="background-image: url(assets/images/mbr-1920x1276.jpg);"><div class="container container-slide"><div class="image_wrapper"><div class="mbr-overlay" style="opacity: 0.5;"></div><img src="assets/images/mbr-1920x1276.jpg"><div class="carousel-caption justify-content-center"><div class="col-10 align-left"><h2 class="mbr-fonts-style display-2"><strong>Reflection #2</strong><br><strong>Need Finding and Prototyping</strong></h2><p class="lead mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>This week’s USERDES class was interesting and fun, we discussed about our application that has a main problem for us students and we must find a solution for that problem. Ms. Jen had an excellent discussion about this topic, she gave us examples that could easily help us find our target application. Before we discussed, she assigned 7 of classmates who has the capability of being a leader, so that our class would be productive and will produce a lot of works. 7 of my classmates were able to be the leader of our class, they had the opportunity to pick one of their best choices to be with them and will able to help him/her find an application. 
<br>	
<br>	With that, the group leaders and members were brainstorming about an application that they will discuss among the class. Our group were able to think of an application, this application will help students know if their professor has logged in or logged out of the school premises. We found it as a problem because some of our classmates were worried about their professor if they’re here or not. We experienced a lot of this scenario and we stayed for an hour just to wait for him /her and there’s no possible way to track him/her, so we find this as a problem and our group is still finding some solutions for this one. We’re still not done with this activity, also we’re designing our application’s interface and to be submitted on Tuesday. &nbsp;<br></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="carousel-item slider-fullscreen-image" data-bg-video-slide="false" style="background-image: url(assets/images/mbr-1-1920x1276.jpg);"><div class="container container-slide"><div class="image_wrapper"><div class="mbr-overlay" style="opacity: 0.6;"></div><img src="assets/images/mbr-1-1920x1276.jpg"><div class="carousel-caption justify-content-center"><div class="col-10 align-right"><h2 class="mbr-fonts-style display-2"><br><strong>Reflection #3</strong><br><strong>First Web Application Using Github and Heroku</strong><br></h2><p class="lead mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>Choose from the large selection of latest pre-made blocks - jumbotrons, hero images, parallax Making my web application was hard since the last time I created it was back in my high school days and I wasn’t really participating on that class because IT for me on that days was boring and waste of time. <br><br>For me to create my web application, I must visit some website that will help me to create my own preferences and own design.
<br>	In doing this kind of activity I have to ask my classmate for possible websites that will give me techniques, codes, and design on my web application. One of our classmates gave us a website which is Codepen, I find it interesting and helpful because you must type the information that you need, then it will give you the possible codes or programs on that application. When it comes to creating a repository on Github, I think that this website is very helpful and convenient for us. You can view your repositories anytime and anywhere. Since it was my first time using that application, I seek some help from my classmates and even the internet. I was having hard time with the commit and push on Github, when I asked for the help of my classmates I was able to finish it. scrolling, video backgrounds, hamburger menu, sticky header and more.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="carousel-item slider-fullscreen-image" data-bg-video-slide="false" style="background-image: url(assets/images/mbr-2-1920x1280.jpg);"><div class="container container-slide"><div class="image_wrapper"><div class="mbr-overlay" style="opacity: 0.6; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></div><img src="assets/images/mbr-2-1920x1280.jpg"><div class="carousel-caption justify-content-center"><div class="col-10 align-center"><h2 class="mbr-fonts-style display-2"><strong><br></strong><br><strong>Reflection #4</strong><br><strong>Userinyerface - Worst UI Practice</strong></h2><p class="lead mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>I was a bit nervous before taking up the quiz because our professor said that It would be a surprise one and everyone have no idea on that quiz.  On that day as well, I came into class as late because I’m not really feeling well that time, so they started the quiz and I’m still on my way to my class. As I approached the door of our classroom, I saw people who are happy and laughing around, so I said to myself that it would be easy because some of my classmates are goofing around and not taking it seriously. When I asked my block mates about the quiz, they said that it was tricky and fun, so I started it by going to the website which is USERINYERFACE, by that name I was thinking if it was a troll or what. The instruction of our professor was just follow the instructions given in the website, on that first page I don’t know what to do because one single click and the website will go to it’s specific command, you have to pay attention on what you’re clicking and you have to read all the instructions before clicking anything on the website. I still remember the time when I was thinking of a password that will be able to surpass all the said command. I stayed for 5 minutes on that page because I can’t able to think of a password on that time and I also clicked on a word that will refresh the page, so I have to start it again and on the last part I was able to figure it out. 
<br>	
<br>	This quiz taught me a lot of lessons, first is that I must read all the instructions before clicking and make any moves. Next, is to follow all the instructions that are needed to surpass the test. By, clicking unnecessary things the program will troll you make fun of you. Lastly, you must be calm in any situations in order for you to think carefully and in organized manner. &nbsp;<br></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="carousel-item slider-fullscreen-image" data-bg-video-slide="false" style="background-image: url(assets/images/mbr-6-1920x1280.jpg);"><div class="container container-slide"><div class="image_wrapper"><div class="mbr-overlay" style="opacity: 0.5; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></div><img src="assets/images/mbr-6-1920x1280.jpg"><div class="carousel-caption justify-content-center"><div class="col-10 align-center"><h2 class="mbr-fonts-style display-2"><strong><br></strong><br><strong>Reflection #5</strong><br><strong>SOCIT Fest</strong><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong></h2><p class="lead mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">My SOCIT Fest experience was really fun, we were able to see some events, attend seminars and different talks. What I enjoyed the most was that there were no class for the 3 whole days of SOCIT. I saw some people who were really into it and some people who weren’t interested in the event. Some of my classmates were part of organizing team, they were part of JISSA, MICROSOFT AND JPCS. They were really stressed because of the responsibilities that were assigned to them.
<br>
<br>Sadly, I’m not part of any organization in our school and all I to do is to watch and be entertained from the events that were created by some of my classmates. My only contribution was my attendance I think and some support for my classmates.&nbsp;<br>As a participant my favorite event was the SOCIT Night, there was live bands, pageant and some events that are truly fun. During the SOCIT Night, a lot of people attended to gather around and celebrate. We had our own party on that night also, we came into our friend’s house and drink to celebrate their success. 
<br>
<br>I expect that next year, a lot of students in SOCIT would be able to help and give some support into this event. I expect that all of us would add more surprises and enthusiasm in the event.

This subject helped me to hone my skills when it comes into designing. It helped me to look at different perspectives when designing. I see them in a deeper manner, because of this subject I also developed my interest in my course.  With the help of our great teacher, it gave me a lot of interest to attend her class and be curious of our next discussion.
<br>
<br>Some of the challenges that I’ve encountered in this subject were coding of the back end of the design, and some of my groupmates who were giving less attention in our project. To be honest, I consider myself as a lazy person, most of my classmates think of that way too, but because of this subject I developed my skills into leading people. 
<br>
<br>I have a lot of expectations in the final term, I think that the finals would be hard on specially with everyone because we have a lot of work to do. This will involve coding, designing and a lot of group works. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><a data-app-prevent-settings="" class="carousel-control carousel-control-prev" role="button" data-slide="prev" href="#slider1-g"><span aria-hidden="true" class="mbri-left mbr-iconfont"></span><span class="sr-only">Previous</span></a><a data-app-prevent-settings="" class="carousel-control carousel-control-next" role="button" data-slide="next" href="#slider1-g"><span aria-hidden="true" class="mbri-right mbr-iconfont"></span><span class="sr-only">Next</span></a></div></div>
